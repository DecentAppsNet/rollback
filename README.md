# DecentAppsNet/rollback

This repository contains the built output of the "DecentAppsNet/rollback" GitHub Action. Its source code is maintained in the [DecentAppsNet/decent-actions monorepo](https://github.com/DecentAppsNet/decent-actions). Documentation for this and other actions is found there as well.

Each action has its own repository like this one to allow clean and simple use with the uses: field in GitHub Actions workflows. This repo is intentionally limited to build artifacts only â€” source code and history are managed centrally.
